# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .paul/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-16)

**Core value:** Any team can self-host one platform that replaces PostHog, Unleash, GrowthBook, Windmill, and their entire SaaS toolchain — building and running products as visual node workflows with enterprise capabilities built in.
**Current focus:** v0.1 Foundation + IAM — Phase 4 (Orgs & Workspaces vertical) starting

## Current Position

Milestone: v0.1 Foundation + IAM
Phase: 4 of 7 (Orgs & Workspaces vertical) — Ready to plan
Plan: Not started
Status: Ready for next PLAN
Last activity: 2026-04-16 — Phase 3 complete: IAM + audit + views; 9 migrations applied; 19 tests green

Progress:
- Milestone: [█████░░░░░] 43% (Phases 1 + 2 + 3 of 7 complete)
- Phase 4: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0% (not started)

## Loop Position

Current loop state:
```

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 9
- Average duration: ~27 min
- Total execution time: ~240 min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total Time | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|------------|----------|
| 01-core-infrastructure | 3/3 ✅ | ~60min | ~20min |
| 02-catalog-foundation | 3/3 ✅ | ~95min | ~32min |
| 03-iam-audit | 4/4 ✅ | ~85min | ~21min |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions
| Decision | Phase | Impact |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Raw SQL with asyncpg, PG-specific features allowed | Init | No ORM |
| Audit in 04_audit schema, cross-cutting | Planning | All features write evt_audit |
| Every phase is a vertical slice | Planning | Schema → repo → service → routes → nodes → UI → Playwright |
| Custom SQL migrator (asyncpg-only, UP/DOWN, rollback, history) | Phase 1 | — |
| Postgres on port 5434; Frontend port 51735 | Phase 1 | Non-standard; avoids conflicts |
| importlib everywhere for numeric dirs | Phase 1 | — |
| Distributed migrations in 09_sql_migrations/; seeds as YAML | Phase 1 refactor | Migrator rglobs |
| fct_* tables have NO business columns (except identity slugs) | Planning | All attrs in dtl_attrs via EAV |
| NCP v1 — sub-features communicate only via `run_node` | Phase 2 | Enforced by lint |
| Catalog DB in `01_catalog`; fct_* use SMALLINT identity PKs | Phase 2 | Documented deviation from UUID v7 rule |
| Effect-must-emit-audit: triple defense (DB CHECK + Pydantic + runner) | Phase 2 | — |
| Pydantic models ARE the manifest schema | Phase 2 | Single source of truth |
| feature.key == metadata.module in NCP v1 | Phase 2 | One feature per module |
| Linter parses both `from X` + `import_module("X")` Call nodes | Phase 2 | — |
| `Any` typing for dynamically-imported modules | Phase 2 | Pyright can't follow importlib |
| NodeContext propagates audit scope + tracing | Phase 2 | — |
| Execution policy per node (timeout/retries/tx modes) | Phase 2 | — |
| Idempotency check before Pydantic validation | Phase 2 Plan 03 | — |
| TransientError is the only retryable exception class | Phase 2 Plan 03 | — |
| Cross-import validator enforces sub-feature boundaries | Phase 2 | Pre-commit hook |
| MCP + scaffolder CLI deferred to v0.2 | Phase 2 | — |
| Per-sub-feature migration layout — each sub-feature owns its SQL | Phase 3 Plan 03 | Scales to 10-30 sub-features |
| Node keys require 3+ segments (feature.sub.action) | Phase 3 Plan 03 | `audit.emit` → `audit.events.emit` |
| Default authz bypasses user_id for audit_category in (system, setup) | Phase 3 Plan 03 | — |
| JSONB codec registered on pool init | Phase 3 Plan 03 | dict⇄JSONB transparent |
| Audit scope triple-defense with setup/failure bypasses | Phase 3 Plan 03 | — |
| Views use MAX(...) FILTER for EAV pivot; hide internal FKs | Phase 3 Plan 04 | Scales; internal refactors invisible |

### Git State
Last commit: 3d11e9c — feat(02-catalog-foundation): Node Catalog Protocol v1 — schema + loader + runner
Branch: feat/pivot
**Phase 3 commit pending** — about to be created during this transition. Will cover: IAM schema (7 sub-feature SQL files) + IAM manifest + audit feature (schema + node + tests) + views (3 migrations) + JSONB codec + authz setup-bypass + 19/19 tests.

### Deferred Issues
None.

### Blockers/Concerns
None.

### Known Gap Closures (complete for v0.1 foundation)
- Node execution policy — Plan 02-03 ✓
- NodeContext contract — Plan 02-03 ✓
- Authorization hook (with setup bypass) — Plan 02-03 + 03-03 ✓
- Cross-import validator — Plan 02-02 ✓
- Trace propagation — Plan 02-03 ✓
- Audit scope enforcement (triple-defense) — Plan 03-03 ✓
- IAM read-path views — Plan 03-04 ✓

### Deferred Gaps (v0.1.5 Runtime Hardening milestone)
- Versioning operational (v1 → v2 migration pattern)
- Async effect dispatch via NATS JetStream
- APISIX gateway sync for request nodes
- Dev hot-reload of catalog on manifest change
- Bulk operation pattern documentation
- Pre-commit hook wiring for linter
- Handler class caching in runner
- NCP v1 §9 doc sync (setup bypass update)
- Materialized views consideration if aggregation costs grow

## Session Continuity
